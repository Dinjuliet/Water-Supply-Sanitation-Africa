# Water-Supply-Sanitation-Africa

# OVERVIEW
This SQL-based project explores community-level datasets from various African countries to uncover insights about water access, sanitation infrastructure, and health outcomes. The project aims to analyze data, identify patterns, and propose informed data-driven recommendations that governments and stakeholders can implement to effectively improve water access and sanitation in African communities.

# 📊 PROJECT SUMMARY

Using SQL, I queried datasets to extract insights such as:

- Water availability per person
- Disease incidence rates
- Functional vs. non-functional water points
- Sanitation maintenance costs
- External support (government/NGO)
- Community satisfaction and accessibility

# 🌍KEY INSIGHTS

- 🇳🇬 **Nigeria** recorded the highest population.
- 🇬🇭 **Ghana** had the highest incidence of waterborne diseases.
- 🇰🇪 **Kenya** had the most functional and non-functional water points.
- 🇹🇿 🇳🇬 🇺🇬 🇬🇭 **Tanzania, Nigeria, Uganda, and Ghana** had the highest sanitation maintenance costs.
- 💧 **Water availability (liters per person per day):**
  - Nigeria: 58.6  
  - Senegal: 57.89  
  - Rwanda: 56.67
 
# 🛠️TOOL USED

- **SQL**
- **Excel**

# 📌BUSINESS QUESTIONS ANSWERED

- Which countries have the highest water availability per capita?
- Where is disease incidence most severe?
- What communities report high sanitation costs?
- Which areas receive both government and NGO support?
- What’s the average distance to the nearest water source?
